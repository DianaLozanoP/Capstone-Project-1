The Budget Manager is a web application designed to help users track their expenses, manage their finances, and maintain a clear overview of their budget.
It is my first Capstone Project, and it is still work in progress. 
### The current feautures include:
* Add money into your wallet
* Create a budget
* Add categories to each budget
* Insert transactions
* Check basic information about Index Funds
