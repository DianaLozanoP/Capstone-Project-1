    <h5 >Investing</h5>
    <p >
      Current technologies have made investing in company stocks easier than ever before.
  You can buy and sell stocks and index funds in seconds using your mobile device.
  Investing in companies takes a lot of research and analysis. However there are other alternatives than just single stock picking.
    </p>
<br>
<h5 >What are Index Funds?</h5>
<p>An index fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a portfolio constructed to match or track the components of a financial market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500). 
  An index mutual fund provides <mark>broad market exposure, low operating expenses, and low portfolio turnover.</mark> </p>
<p>These funds follow their benchmark index regardless of the state of the markets.
“Indexing” is a form of passive fund management. Instead of a fund portfolio manager actively stock picking and market timing—that is, 
choosing securities to invest in and strategizing when to buy and sell them—the fund manager builds a portfolio whose holdings mirror the securities of a particular index. The idea is that by mimicking the index profile—the stock market as a whole or a broad segment of it—the fund will also match its performance.
(Jason Fernando via Investopedia, Dec 07/2023).</p>
<p>Indexing a great way to invest your money because it brings you exposure to many companies in different sectors. 
  You do not have to spend time picking and choosing which company will perform better, and deciding when is a good time to sell or when is a good time to keep holding.</p>
<p>The returns of Index Funds can vary depending on the year, but usually investors are holding them long-term.

<h5>What are ETFs?</h5>
<p>An ETF is called an exchange-traded fund because it is traded on an exchange just like stocks are.</p>
<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-light">An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a stock does.</li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-light">ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold; this is different from mutual funds, which only trade once a day after the market closes.</li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-light">ETFs can contain all types of investments, including stocks, commodities, or bonds; some offer U.S.-only holdings, while others are international.</li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-light">ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions than buying the stocks individually.</li>
